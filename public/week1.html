        Can work with Git in the terminal.<br /><br />
      </div>
      use the the following command to initialize a new repository:
      <br />
      <div class="code">
        <code>git init</code>
      </div>
      now link to a remote repository you want to push your changes to.<br />
      <div class="code">
        <code>git remote add origin [URL] </code>
      </div>
      after initializing git, you stage all changes to git typing the
      command:<br />
      <div class="code">
        <code>git add -A</code>
        <br />
      </div>
      you can now commit the staged files with the command:
      <div class="code">
        <code>git commit -m "commit message here"</code>
      </div>
      The -u flag sets the upstream, linking your local branch to the
      corresponding remote branch.<br />
      <div class="code">
        <code>git push -u origin [branch_name]</code>
      </div>
      After this initial setup, you can use
      <div class="code">
        <code>git push</code>
      </div>
      to push future commits to the same remote branch.

        Understand and can work with data types in Javascript.<br />
        Understands type coercion and strategies to avoid it.<br /><br />
      </div>
      There are 7 primitive datatypes in javascript and 3 non primitive.
      <br />
      <br />
      <div class="subHeadline1">Primitive datatypes:<br /></div>
      "Number" represents both integers and float points.
      <div class="code">
        <code>let x = 42;</code>
        <br />
        <code>let y = 3.14;</code>
      </div>
      "String" represents a sequence of characters.
      <div class="code">
        <code>let str = "Hello Anders!";</code>
      </div>
      "Boolean" represents a binary value which is either true or false.
      <div class="code">
        <code>let thisIsTheWay = true;</code>
      </div>
      "Undefined" represents a variable that has been declared but has no value.
      <div class="code">
        <code>let z;</code>
      </div>
      "Null" represents a variable that has been declared and intentionally has
      no value.
      <div class="code">
        <code>let empty = null;</code>
      </div>
      "Symbols" represents a variable that is garaunteed to be unique. <br />
      Symbol is a built-in object whose constructor returns a symbol primitive â€”
      also called a Symbol value or just a Symbol
      <br />
      <div class="code">
        <code>const symbol1 = Symbol("description");</code>
      </div>
      "BigInt" represents large integers that cant be represented by a number.
      <div class="code">
        <code>const bigInt = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;</code>
      </div>
      <br />
      <div class="subHeadline1">Non primitive datatypes:</div>
      "Object" represents a collection of key:value pairs.
      <div class="code">
        <code>
          const obj1 = {<br />
          <p>&emsp;name: "Oscar",</p>
          <p>&emsp;age: 29.</p>
          };
        </code>
      </div>
      <br />
      "Array" represents a list containing a collection of values.
      <div class="code">
        <code>const myList = [1, 2, 3, "hello", obj1];</code>
      </div>
      "Function" represents a reference to an object.
      <div class="code">
        <code> function myFunction(){ console.log(obj1) } </code>
      </div>
      <br />
      <div class="subHeadline1">Type coercion and conversion</div>
      <br />
      Type coercion in JavaScript refers to the automatic or implicit conversion
      of values from one data type to another.<br />
      This occurs during the evaluation of expressions involving mixed types.
      JavaScript tries to predict what you mean and performs a type coercion to
      accomplish that.<br />
      <div class="code">
        <code>
          let x = "5";<br />
          let y = 10;<br />

          // Type coercion: the number 10 is implicitly converted to a string<br />
          let z = x + y; // z becomes a string "510", not 15<br />
        </code>
      </div>
      Type conversion, on the other hand, refers to the manual or explicit
      conversion between types. This is done using built-in functions.<br />
      <div class="code">
        <code>
          let a = "5";<br />
          let b = 3;<br />

          // Type conversion: we explicitly convert string to number<br />
          let c = parseInt(a) + b; // c becomes 8, not "53"<br /><br />

          //parseInt(): Converts to integer <br />
          //parseFloat(): Converts to floating-point number <br />
          //String(): Converts to string<br />
          //Boolean(): Converts to boolean<br />
        </code>
      </div>
      <br />

        Can explain what Node.js is and how to run files with it.
      </div>
      <br />
      Node.js is an open source cross platform runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine
      that allows you to execute JavaScript code server-side.<br />
      Unlike client-side JavaScript that runs in a browser, Node.js enables
      backend development, API creation, and interaction with databases, among
      other tasks.<br />
      After installing node.js one way you can execute a JavaScript file is by
      navigating to its location in the terminal and use the command:<br />
      <div class="code"><code>node filename.js</code></div>
      <br />
      <div class="subHeadline">
        Can design a REST API and knows the two REST conventions we will follow
        and why they exist and what they map to.<br /><br />
      </div>
      <div class="subHeadline1">
        Standardization of the endpoints which should reflect the underlying
        collections in your system.<br /><br />
      </div>
      Collection Endpoints (e.g., /users):<br />

      GET: Retrieve all users from the 'users' collection.<br />
      POST: Create a new user within the 'users' collection.<br />
      Single Resource Endpoints (e.g., /users/{id}):<br />

      GET: Retrieve a specific user by ID.<br />
      PUT: Update a specific user by ID.<br />
      DELETE: Delete a specific user by ID.<br />
      <br />
      <div class="subHeadline1">Ordering of the HTTP methods.</div>
      <br />
      The hierarchy we practice in our rest API is GET >> POST >> PATCH >> PUT
      >> DELETE
