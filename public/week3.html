            Understands the use case for Nodemon and its limitation for development.<br> 
        </div>
        <br>
        Nodemon watches your Node.js application files and automatically restarts the server whenever changes are detected.<br>
        This saves time during development by eliminating the need to manually stop and restart the Node.js application.<br>
        <br>
        Nodemon is intended for development purposes only. It is not recommended for production environments.
        It consumes more system resources since it keeps watching files for changes, which might be an issue for very large projects.

            Can use loop methods (+map, +filter, %reduce). Can choose the right one at the appropriate time.<br>

            There are mainly 2 types of loops in javascript<br>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>for loops</li>
            <li>while loops</li>
        
        </ul>
        for loop is used when you know how many times you want to run a loop.<br>
        while loop is used when you dont know how many times you want to run a loop until a condition is met.<br>

            Functional approach.<br>

        <div class="code">

                const arr = [1, 2, 3];<br>
                const doubled = arr.map(x => x * 2);<br>
            </code>
        </div>
        <br>
        Immutability: A functional approach often avoids changing state or data.<br>
        This makes the code easier to understand and debug.
        <br>
        alternatively the same operation could be done using a for loop.
        <br>
        <div class="code">
            <code>
                let arr = [1, 2, 3];<br>
                let doubled = [];<br>
                <br>
                for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {<br>
                    <p>&emsp;doubled.push(arr[i] * 2);<br>
                }
            </code>
        </div>
        <br>
        State Modification: The doubled array is declared outside of the loop and its state is modified within the loop.<br>
        This makes it harder to reason about the state of doubled at any point in the program.<br>

        Body parsing is used for a number of reasons, one of them is for data sensitivity.<br>
        Query strings are visible in the URL, making them inappropriate for confidential information. Request bodies are more secure.<br>

        <div class = "subHeadline">
            Can use the right terminology when it comes to the different parts of an URL.
        </div>
        <br>
        The URL (Uniform resource locator) has ten parts.<br>
        The protocol, subdomain, top-level domain, second-level domain, subdirectory, parameter, port,<br>
        path, query, and fragment. A URL doesn't have to contain all of these parts at once<br>
        I will go over the protocol, domain-name, query and path.<br>

            "https://" is the protocol.<br>

            "com" is the top level domain.<br>
