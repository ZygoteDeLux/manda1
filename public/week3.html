            Understands the use case for Nodemon and its limitation for development.<br> 
        </div>
        <br>
        Nodemon watches your Node.js application files and automatically restarts the server whenever changes are detected.<br>
        This saves time during development by eliminating the need to manually stop and restart the Node.js application.<br>
        <br>
        Nodemon is intended for development purposes only. It is not recommended for production environments.
        It consumes more system resources since it keeps watching files for changes, which might be an issue for very large projects.
